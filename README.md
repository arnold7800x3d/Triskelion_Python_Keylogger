# Triskelion: A Python Based Software Keylogger for Vulnerability Assessment in the Cyberspace.

The rapid evolution of technology, driven by innovative solutions, research, and market demands, has significantly advanced communication, networking, hardware, and software sectors. However, these advancements have also facilitated the rise of cybercrimes, with keylogger attacks being a notable threat to data security and privacy. This project aims to address gaps in effective detection mechanisms for and the knowledge availed to the public about software keyloggers. 

The objective is to design and develop a Python-based software keylogger named Triskelion, which will be used to assess vulnerabilities in cyberspace through an offensive approach. Triskelion will capture keystrokes, clipboard data, and screenshots from a target machine, operating in an ethically controlled environment to ensure legitimate use. The collected data will be analyzed to gain insights into keylogger evasion techniques, functionalities, and threat scope. The expected outcome is to enhance the understanding of keylogger behaviour, which will inform the development of more robust and dynamic detection mechanisms. These findings will also aid in raising user awareness about the risks posed by keyloggers and the importance of protecting sensitive information. 

Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the cybersecurity field by providing solutions that mitigate the impact of keylogger attacks and uphold data integrity and user privacy.


## Repository Structure
- `Documentation` : Contains the project documentation, which so far is the proposal document.
- `System Diagrams` : Contains the analyis and design diagrams for the project.
- `main.py` : This is the actual keylogger program. 
- `requirements.txt` : This is a text file containing the python modules needed for the project.
- `README.md` : This is the README file for the project.

## Documentation
The documentation at this stage is the Project Proposal. It contains 3 chapters i.e.
- Introduction: This is the first chapter. It contains the bulk of the proposal as it brings the project to life highlighting the background information, problem statement, objectives, research questions, the justifications, scope, limitations and delimitations of the project. It serves the purpose of lating the foundation for the research to give an understanding on what is known about keyloggers, what the project aims to achieve and its contribution to existing knowledge in the field of cybersecurity.
- Literature Review - This is the second chapter which contains a summary of related literature involving keyloggers. It reviews the literature and reveals gaps and conflicts in prior research and places the research of Triskelion within the context of the existing literature.
- Methodology. This is the third chapter of the project proposal. It highlights the methodology and its justification, the methodology diagram, project deliverables and the tools and techniques to be employed for the project.

## System Diagrams

## Tools
The tools used in the development of Triskelion include:
- `Python` :  Python is a popular high-level interpreted programming language that is easy to understand, easy to learn, and very flexible. It is the language used to develop Triskelion. [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- `Flask` : Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to develop Python-based webapplications as well as Application Programming Interfaces. [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
